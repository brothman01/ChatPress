ChatPress creates a shortcode for an embeddable chat that the administrator can embed in the pages so that logged in visitors to the site who have the required user role can chat with each other using AJAX calls to the server to display messages.  The administrator can also, at any time, delete messages that are not up to their standards.

## Shortcode:
`[chatpress_channel id="xx"]`
where `xx` is the id of the channel post
-- OR --
just look at the list view of every chatpress channel on the dashboard and copy what is in the 'Shortcode' column.
